to me, Curiosity, Anuj, Ruella 
Yes sir it is the right file as with the letters the file becomes too large

Also sir can you let me know when I will get the print by?

Riyan,
Is this the right file? A cryptex normally has text or numbers on top of it. Please confirm.

Riyan,

So the charges for the print would be 
Rs 450 for the first print and Rs 200 for every subsequent print.
If you want all 7 prints
450× 6×200 =  Rs 1650
9819057179
Do let Anuj sir know if you want to proceed.

PS. May not be online for next couple days so please copy all.
